# TTS_frontend
This project takes in a sample conversation between customers and workers in the Coop at Haverford College and outputs the possible ways it could sound like along with some prosodic markings. 

A few notes:
  The word-to-phoneme mappings are created with the help of CMU Dictionary. 
  The package textblob (https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob) is used to mark the words into proper parts of speeches.
  

To be able to use this program, you need to have textblob package installed. 

This project has been facilitated by Professor Jane Chandlee and was a joint venture with Travis Grant, Haverford '20.
